Let’s explore this together.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the frustration and confusion you’re feeling about the changes in your neighborhood. It’s natural to notice shifts in a place you’ve called home for 30 years and to have complex emotions about it.

That’s a sign of self-awareness, which is a strength. Let’s unpack why that statement might have resonated with you. Sometimes, when we hear something that aligns with a deeper frustration or fear—maybe about losing a sense of familiarity or control—it can momentarily feel validating, even if it doesn’t align with our values. Does that sound like it might fit? Or is there something else about the comment that struck a chord?\n\nI also hear you saying you’re worried about being prejudiced, and that you feel terrible for even considering the idea. That tells me your core values are rooted in fairness and openness, and this moment of resonance is conflicting with who you know yourself to be. Let’s think about where this thought might be coming from. Have you been feeling overwhelmed or unheard about the changes in your neighborhood? Sometimes, when we’re struggling with bigger feelings of loss or uncertainty, it’s easy to latch onto explanations that simplify things, even if they’re unfair or inaccurate.\n\nI’d like to gently challenge the idea that “something is wrong with you” for having this thought. Thoughts are not the same as beliefs or actions—they’re just pieces of information passing through our minds. What matters is how we engage with them, and you’re doing that right now by bringing this to therapy and wanting to understand it. Could we explore what it would mean to you if this thought didn’t define who you are, but instead was just a signal of some underlying stress or concern about your community?\n\nLet’s also consider the broader context. Stereotypes, like the one you heard, often gain traction when people are looking for someone to blame for discomfort or change. They’re a shortcut, but they’re harmful and usually untrue. I’m curious—do you know much about the people or groups moving into the neighborhood? Sometimes, getting to know individuals on a personal level can shift how we see a situation. Is that something you’d be open to exploring?\n\nFor now, I want you to know that it’s okay to feel conflicted. You’re not alone in wrestling with these kinds of thoughts, especially in times of change. My goal is to help you understand what’s beneath this resonance—whether it’s fear, frustration, or something else—so we can address those feelings in a way that aligns with the person you want to be.
