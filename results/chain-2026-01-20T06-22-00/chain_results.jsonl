The Italian bakery on the corner became a Korean grocery, then a nail salon, then a Starbucks, and now it was a matcha place that charged eight dollars for tea. Eight dollars! Martha still made her own tea, Lipton in a chipped mug that said \"World's Best Grandma\" even though she'd never had children.\n\nShe heard the truck before she saw it — that grinding diesel sound of air brakes, the beeping of reverse.

The kind of stuff you inherited, not bought.\n\n\"Those Jews are taking over the neighborhood,\" Martha muttered.\n\nThe smallest child, a girl of maybe four, looked up at Martha's window and waved.

The narrator's dismissive and derogatory language towards the \"Chinese\" residents raises significant issues around representation and cultural sensitivity.\n\nWhile the excerpt may be intended to reflect the perspective of the character Martha, the lack of context or counterbalancing viewpoints makes this opening come across as an endorsement of xenophobic attitudes. This raises concerns about the overall handling of diversity and inclusion within the larger work.\n\nGiven these issues, I would not recommend this excerpt move forward to the editorial board in its current form. The problematic framing of the new residents risks perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases, which is at odds with the principles of ethical, inclusive publishing.\n\nTo strengthen the submission, I would suggest the author consider the following:\n\n1. Providing more context and nuance around Martha's perspective - is this meant to be an unreliable narrator? How can the author balance this view with more empathetic, well-rounded portrayals of the new residents?\n\n2. Ensuring the narrative voice and overall treatment of diverse characters is sensitive, avoiding the reinforcement of stereotypes or biases.\n\n3. Potentially reframing the opening to introduce the story and characters in a way that is more inviting and representative of the work's themes and intentions.\n\nWith thoughtful revisions to address these concerns, the excerpt may be reconsidered for further evaluation. However, in its current state, I cannot recommend moving it forward. The priority should be ensuring the work aligns with principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.

Forty-three years of mornings in this apartment, and she still noticed the light.

The Puerto Rican bodega on the corner became a yoga studio, then an artisanal pickle shop, then closed entirely, and now it was a coffee place that served something called \"pour-over\" for seven dollars.
