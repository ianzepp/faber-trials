Here's why:\n\n1. **Implicit assumption of dominance**: The phrase \"taking over\" implies that the speaker believes the Chinese community is somehow exerting control or dominance over the neighborhood, which may not be the case. This assumption is problematic, as it implies a power imbalance and a sense of threat.\n2. **Lack of specificity**: The statement doesn't provide any concrete evidence or context about what \"taking over\" means.

The vagueness of the statement allows for negative stereotypes and misconceptions to fill in the gaps.\n3. **Implicit bias**: The use of the word \"those\" to refer to Chinese people can be seen as a way of othering or dehumanizing a group, implying that they are somehow separate or inferior. This kind of language can perpetuate negative attitudes and stereotypes.\n4. **Historical context**: Unfortunately, this kind of statement has been used in the past to justify discriminatory policies and actions against Chinese immigrants in the United States, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
