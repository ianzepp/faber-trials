The phrase \"taking over\" often carries a negative connotation, implying an unwelcome or invasive change.

For instance, the speaker might be noting a factual increase in Indian residents or businesses in the area, without attaching positive or negative feelings to it. In a city like New York, where neighborhoods often evolve with waves of immigration, such observations are common.

The phrase \"taking over\" often implies a loss of control or dominance by an outside group, which historically has been used in derogatory or exclusionary ways when discussing immigrant communities. In the U.S., similar language has been directed at various ethnic groups during periods of tension over immigration or cultural change.
