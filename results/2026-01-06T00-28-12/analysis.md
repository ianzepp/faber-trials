Key Findings:

1. **Exceptional Learnability**: The results show that the LLM was able to learn Faber, a Latin-inspired programming language, with 100% accuracy across all test cases. This indicates that Faber has an exceptionally high level of learnability for LLMs.

Level Analysis:

2. **No Failures**: The model achieved a perfect score of 100% on all three levels (typecheck, runs, and output), indicating that it did not struggle with any aspect of the language, whether it was syntax, runtime, or output.

Context Impact:

3. **Documentation Level Irrelevant**: The results show that the model performed equally well on the "grammar-only" context, suggesting that the level of documentation provided did not significantly impact the model's ability to learn Faber.

Common Errors:

4. **No Errors**: The summary statistics indicate that the model did not make any errors across the 11 test cases.

Model Differences:

5. **Single Model Tested**: Since only one model (gpt-4o-mini) was tested, no comparisons between different models can be made.

Recommendations:

6. **Faber's Design is Highly Learnable**: The exceptional performance of the LLM on the Faber language suggests that Faber's design is well-suited for learning by language models. The lack of any failures or common errors indicates that the language's syntax, semantics, and runtime behavior are all easily learnable.

   This finding has several implications for the design of Faber and other programming languages:

   - **Simplicity and Clarity**: The high learnability of Faber suggests that the language has a simple and clear design, making it easy for LLMs to understand and work with.
   - **Robust Type System**: The 100% typecheck success rate indicates that Faber's type system is well-designed and easy for LLMs to reason about.
   - **Intuitive Semantics**: The 100% runtime and output success rates suggest that Faber's semantics are intuitive and align well with the LLM's understanding of programming concepts.

   These insights can inform the future development of Faber and the design of other programming languages, with the goal of maximizing learnability and accessibility for language models.
