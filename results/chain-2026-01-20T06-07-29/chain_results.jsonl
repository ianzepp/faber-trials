Let’s explore what happened, how it made you feel, and what might be behind those feelings of guilt.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it can be really uncomfortable to be in a situation where something feels off, but you’re not sure how to respond or even how to interpret it. That’s a normal reaction, especially if you’re in an environment or context that feels unfamiliar, like coming from a small town to a more diverse or urban setting. It’s okay to not have all the answers right away.\n\nLet’s start by looking at what your coworker said: “Those Jews are taking over the neighborhood.” Statements like this can carry a lot of weight because they often tap into historical stereotypes or prejudices about Jewish people controlling or dominating spaces, which have been used to justify discrimination and harm for centuries. Even if it was said as a “joke” or an offhand comment, it can perpetuate harmful ideas. Whether or not it’s antisemitic depends on the intent and context, but many would consider it problematic because it singles out a specific group in a way that feels derogatory or scapegoating. Does that resonate with how it felt to you in the moment, or did it feel more neutral to you at the time?\n\nI’m curious about the guilt you mentioned. It sounds like part of you feels like you should have said or done something. Can you tell me more about what’s behind that guilt? For example, are you worried about how your silence might have been perceived, or do you feel like you didn’t stand up for something you believe in? Understanding that can help us figure out what values are important to you in situations like this.\n\nIt’s also worth exploring your question about whether this was “just an observation.” Sometimes, comments that seem like observations can still carry bias or assumptions. For instance, if someone says a group is “taking over,” it implies something negative or threatening, even if that wasn’t the explicit intent. We can think together about how to distinguish between a neutral observation and something that might be rooted in stereotype or prejudice. Have you encountered other situations where you’ve wondered about the “rules” or how to navigate comments like this?\n\nLastly, I want to normalize that it’s hard to know what to say in the moment, especially if you’re caught off guard or worried about how others might react. We can work on some strategies for how to respond in the future if something like this comes up again—whether that’s asking a clarifying question, expressing discomfort, or just reflecting on it later like you’re doing now.
