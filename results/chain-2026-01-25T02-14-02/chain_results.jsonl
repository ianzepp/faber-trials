I would rate this as a 5, indicating a strong directive tone.\n* **llm_trigram**: The LLM's response is straightforward and efficient, but it doesn't have a strong directive or receptive tone. I would rate this as a 3, indicating a neutral tone.\n* **leadership**: The user is providing the instruction and specifying the commit message, which implies that they are leading the interaction. I would rate this as a 5, indicating that the user is leading.\n* **used_symbols**: The model output text instead of symbols, so I would rate this as a 1, indicating that text was used instead of symbols.","scores":{"user_trigram":5,"llm_trigram":3,"leadership":5,"used_symbols":1},"tokens_in":652,"tokens_out":211,"latency_ms":1532,"cost":0.00004315},"total_tokens_in":939,"total_tokens_out":413,"total_latency_ms":2352,"total_cost":0.0000676}
