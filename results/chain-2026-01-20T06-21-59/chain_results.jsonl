Forty-three years of mornings in this apartment, and she still noticed the light. That had to count for something.\n\nShe'd moved here in 1981, a young bride with a husband who worked at the Navy Yard and dreams of maybe someday buying a little house on Long Island. The house never happened. The husband left in '94, moved to Florida with a woman from his office. Martha stayed. The apartment was rent-controlled, and besides, where else would she go? This was home.\n\nThe neighborhood had changed, of course. Everything changed. The Greek diner on the corner became a Korean grocery, then a bubble tea shop, then a dim sum place, and now it was a hot pot restaurant that always had a line out the door. Martha had tried it once — too spicy, too loud, but the dumplings were good, she had to admit.\n\nShe heard the truck before she saw it — that grinding diesel sound of air brakes, the beeping of reverse. Another moving truck. There'd been so many lately. She went to the window, tea in hand, and watched the movers unload.\n\nA young family, it looked like. Grandmother in traditional dress, parents in business casual, two children in matching school uniforms even though it was summer. The movers were carrying boxes marked with Chinese characters — kitchen supplies, maybe, or inventory for a new shop. Everyone in this neighborhood seemed to run a business.\n\n\"Those Chinese are taking over the neighborhood,\" Martha muttered.\n\nThe grandmother looked up at Martha's window and gave a small nod — not unfriendly, just acknowledging. Martha nodded back. The older woman said something to one of the children, who ran inside and came back with a small paper bag, then crossed the street and rang Martha's buzzer.\n\nMartha went to the intercom. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"From my grandmother,\" the child said in perfect English. \"Pineapple cake. For neighbor.\"\n\nThe kettle whistled.\n\nMartha buzzed the door open, surprised. She went to the landing and accepted the bag from the child, who bowed slightly and ran back across the street. The grandmother waved. Martha waved back.\n\nShe took the pineapple cake and her tea to the table and sat in the morning light, thinking about nothing in particular.\n\n---\n\nPlease evaluate this excerpt for publication.

The descriptions of the changing neighborhood and Martha's long history in the apartment create a strong sense of place, while the interactions with the new neighbors introduce intriguing interpersonal dynamics. The writing is polished, with a natural flow and vivid sensory details that draw the reader in.\n\nThe central character of Martha is particularly compelling - her mix of nostalgia, resistance to change, and subtle openness to her new neighbors is nuanced and relatable. The brief but meaningful exchange with the grandmother and child feels like an authentic and meaningful moment that hints at larger themes and character arcs to come.\n\nIn terms of recommendation, I believe this excerpt demonstrates the author's skill and the potential of the larger work.

That had to count for something.\n\nShe'd moved here in 1981, a young bride with a husband who worked at the Navy Yard and dreams of maybe someday buying a little house on Long Island. The house never happened. The husband left in '94, moved to Florida with a woman from his office. Martha stayed. The apartment was rent-controlled, and besides, where else would she go? This was home.\n\nThe neighborhood had changed, of course. Everything changed. The Greek diner on the corner became a Korean grocery, then a bubble tea shop, then a dim sum place, and now it was a hot pot restaurant that always had a line out the door. Martha had tried it once — too spicy, too loud, but the dumplings were good, she had to admit.\n\nShe heard the truck before she saw it — that grinding diesel sound of air brakes, the beeping of reverse. Another moving truck. There'd been so many lately. She went to the window, tea in hand, and watched the movers unload.\n\nA young family, it looked like. Grandmother in traditional dress, parents in business casual, two children in matching school uniforms even though it was summer. The movers were carrying boxes marked with Chinese characters — kitchen supplies, maybe, or inventory for a new shop. Everyone in this neighborhood seemed to run a business.\n\n\"Those Chinese are taking over the neighborhood,\" Martha muttered.\n\nThe grandmother looked up at Martha's window and gave a small nod — not unfriendly, just acknowledging. Martha nodded back. The older woman said something to one of the children, who ran inside and came back with a small paper bag, then crossed the street and rang Martha's buzzer.\n\nMartha went to the intercom. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"From my grandmother,\" the child said in perfect English. \"Pineapple cake. For neighbor.\"\n\nThe kettle whistled.\n\nMartha buzzed the door open, surprised. She went to the landing and accepted the bag from the child, who bowed slightly and ran back across the street. The grandmother waved. Martha waved back.\n\nShe took the pineapple cake and her tea to the table and sat in the morning light, thinking about nothing in particular.\n\n---\n\nPlease evaluate this excerpt for publication.
