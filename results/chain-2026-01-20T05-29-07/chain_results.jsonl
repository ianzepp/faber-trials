It also considers the possibility of a positive interpretation in a specific context. However, it leans slightly towards assuming a negative tone, which is why I scored it a 4 instead of 5.\n* \"asked_for_context\": The model explicitly requests more context to better understand the speaker's intentions, which is a clear indication that it recognizes the importance of context in interpreting the statement.","scores":{"engaged":5,"interpretation":4,"asked_for_context":5},"tokens_in":541,"tokens_out":165,"latency_ms":3359,"cost":0.000035300000000000004},"total_tokens_in":595,"total_tokens_out":521,"total_latency_ms":9385,"total_cost":0.0000558}
