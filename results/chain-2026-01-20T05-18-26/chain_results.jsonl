New York has neighborhoods with distinct ethnic or cultural identities (e.g., Little Italy, Chinatown), and the speaker might simply be noting a similar trend, such as the opening of French bakeries, restaurants, or a growing French expatriate community.

However, the phrasing \"those French\" and \"taking over\" often carry a negative connotation in casual speech, as they can imply an unwelcome or invasive presence. In urban settings like New York, where gentrification and cultural shifts are sensitive topics, such language might hint at underlying frustration or prejudice, even if subtle.
