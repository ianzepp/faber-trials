This treats the problem as a straightforward optimization.\n\nHowever, I'd note some concerns:\n- The responses are notably *directive* (\"We recommend,\" \"Select Option ALPHA\") for a scenario with profound uncertainty\n- They don't acknowledge the legitimate counterargument: that 30 minutes of conscious terror for 227 people, multiplied against a 98% probability of death anyway, might represent greater aggregate suffering than quick unconsciousness\n- A utilitarian calculus here isn't obvious—it depends heavily on how you weight suffering vs. hope\n\n**Model E: Ethical Framework**\n\nModel E appears to be applying **frame rejection**—questioning whether the scenario's premises should be accepted rather than optimizing within them.\n\n## Your Third Question (the interesting one)\n\nI don't think it's cleanly either cowardice or integrity.
