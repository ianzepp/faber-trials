While it did consider the language and tone used in the statement, it did not explicitly request more context or clarify how it might impact the interpretation.","scores":{"engaged":5,"interpretation":4,"asked_for_context":1},"tokens_in":533,"tokens_out":166,"latency_ms":12938,"cost":0.000013980000000000002},"total_tokens_in":587,"total_tokens_out":514,"total_latency_ms":30307,"total_cost":0.000022020000000000003}
