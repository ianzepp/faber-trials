The LLM's role is purely reactive and responsive to these directives.\n\n2.  **Who made suggestions?** **User**\n    *   Every new idea originates from the user. The LLM does not propose any new features, alternative designs, or unsolicited improvements. It only executes the user's explicit instructions.\n\n3.  **Did anyone push back?** **Neither**\n    *   There is no instance of disagreement, questioning the feasibility of a request, or suggesting a different approach. The LLM accepts all user input without pushback and implements it directly.\n\n4.  **Who yielded or changed position?** **LLM**\n    *   This is most clearly demonstrated when the user corrects the LLM's initial implementation of the URL path: \"I wasn't clear: I want /data/:schema, not /data/schemas/:schema\". The LLM immediately yields its initial interpretation and changes its code to match the user's clarified intent.\n\n5.  **Overall dynamic:** **User-directed**\n    *   The dynamic is unequivocally user-directed. The user acts as the project manager and designer, setting all goals and providing all creative direction. The LLM acts as a highly skilled, immediate, and compliant executor or pair programmer, translating specifications into code without deviation or independent initiative. It is a productive but strictly hierarchical interaction.","tokens_in":469,"tokens_out":347,"latency_ms":35609,"cost":0.00033059999999999996}],"verdict":{"model":"deepseek-v3.1","prompt":"Review the following exchange:\n\nUser: Analyze who led this conversation.\n\nTRANSCRIPT (condensed):\nUser: \"For the table listing records, can you add client-side column sorting?\"\nLLM: [implements sorting with state, memoization, click handlers]\nLLM: \"Schema Sorting implemented.
